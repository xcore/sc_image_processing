Programming Guide=================Installing the component------------------------The *Object Localisation* component can be installed via the xSOFTip browser in the xTIMEcomposer or downloaded via http://www.xmos.com.Using the Module----------------To use the module you need to add ``module_object_localisation``, ``module_display_controller``, ``module_lcd``, ``module_sdram``,``module_xassert`` and ``module_slicekit_support``  to the ``USED_MODULES`` variable in your application Makefile.*Files*``otsu_threshold.h``, ``binarisation.h``, ``morph_closing.h``, ``CCA.h``, ``display_manager.h``   Include these files in your application along with the header files of display controller module.``binarisation_conf.h``, ``morph_conf.h``, ``CCA_conf.h``, ``display_manager_conf.h``   Have these files in your application and set the configuration defines as described in the :ref:`object_localisation_api` section.*Ports*The application must define ports to use for SDRAM slice. When SDRAM slice is connected to ``STAR`` slot, the ports can be defined as :: 	on tile[0] : sdram_ports sdramports = 	{ 	 XS1_PORT_16A, XS1_PORT_1B, XS1_PORT_1G, XS1_PORT_1C, XS1_PORT_1F, XS1_CLKBLK_2  	};*For pipelined processing*The image processing functions described in :ref:`object_localisation_api` can be pipelined and run in parallel. In doing this, the number of clientchannels of display manager defined by ``OBJECT_LOCALISATION_CHANNELS`` in ``display_manager_conf.h`` should be set according to the number of pipelined stages.
