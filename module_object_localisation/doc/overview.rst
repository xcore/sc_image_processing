Overview========This component is a machine vision application. It locates the objects in a given colour or gray image. The image should contain bright objects on a dark background or vice versa.The following image processing functions are implemented to achieve object localisation:   - Otsu's threshold computation   - Binarisation   - Morphological closing   - Single pass connected component analysisNote that the implementation of these functions allow parallel pipelined processing of images.
