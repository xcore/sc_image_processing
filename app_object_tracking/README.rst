Description
-----------

This demonstration uses the sliceKIT hardware and software listed below together to locate objects (blobs) on still colour or gray images and create an interactive display of processed images on the LCD. It demonstrates a pipeline of typical processing steps common in machine vision and some computer vision applications including "Otsu's" thresholding method, morphological operations and connected component analysis. The results are dislayed interactively on the LCD.
