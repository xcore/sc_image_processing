:scope: Example
:description: A demonstration of basic machine vision techniques on xCore multicore microcontrollers 
:keywords: Machine Vision, Image Processing, LCD
:boards: XA-SK-SCR480, XA-SK-SDRAM

Description
-----------

This demonstration uses the sliceKIT hardware and software listed below together to locate objects (blobs) on still colour or gray images and create an interactive display of processed images on the LCD. It demonstrates a pipeline of typical processing steps common in machine vision and some computer vision applications including "Otsu's" thresholding method, morphological operations and connected component analysis. The results are dislayed interactively on the LCD.

Typical usage of the components showcased in this demo would be in a low-cost embedded machine vision applications such as toys or industrial inspection featuring reliably controlled lighting conditions.

XMOS multicore microcontrollers are also highly suitable for less orthodox image processing applications such as optical flow, high speed region-of-interest tracking and blob detection where low cost, low power and small form factor are required where complex PC or DSP based solutions are not feasible. Please contact your XMOS sales representative to discuss any specific requirements in more detail.
